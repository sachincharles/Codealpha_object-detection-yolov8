# Codealpha_object-detection-yolov8
# 🎯 Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8  This project is a part of the **Code Alpha Internship Program**, focused on real-time object detection using **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV**. The application captures live video input from a webcam (or external camera) and detects multiple objects in real-time, drawing bounding boxes and labels.  ---  ## 📌 Features  - ✅ Real-time object detection - ✅ Live camera feed using OpenCV - ✅ YOLOv8 model integration (Ultralytics) - ✅ Easily extensible for object tracking (SORT/Deep SORT)  ---  ## 📸 Demo  *(Insert GIF or screenshot here)*  ---  ## 🛠️ Tech Stack  - Python - OpenCV - YOLOv8 (`ultralytics` library) - macOS webcam / iPhone camera support (AVFoundation)
